                <h2>Is it Safe to Have Plants in Your Bedroom?</h2>
                <h3>"Is it OK to have plants in my bedroom?"</h3>
                   <p>It's fairly common to hear, "you shouldn't keep houseplants in the bedroom because they're not safe". This is based on the fact that most plants will release Carbon Dioxide and absorb Oxygen from the air while you're sleeping. <br> It's totally true that many houseplants do this. But the reality is that the amount of Carbon Dioxide released and Oxygen absorbed is minimal. This means that it's absolutely safe to have plants in your bedroom.</p>

                <h2>How Often Should I Water my Plants?</h2>
                <h3>"How often should you water houseplants?"</h3>
                   <p>Many houseplants want their potting soil moist during the Spring, Summer, and Autumn and just a bit drier during Winter. Very wet or saturated soil should usually be avoided <br>
                    How often you need to reach for the watering can to achieve this goal depends. But as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to water most plants once or twice a week during Spring, Summer, and Autumn and once a week or fortnight in Winter.</p>

                <h2>Should You Mist Your Houseplants?</h2>
                <h3>"Should I Mist My Houseplants?"</h3>
                    <p>Misting is an effective way to raise the humidity level around your houseplants. But it's not a long term solution to resolving low humidity issues, and by itself, reaching for the plant mister every few days won't make your tropical plants happy. <br> The lack of humidity in your home won't be solved by a good misting, and you'll need to look at other ways of sorting this problem out.
